Bug list:

FIXED ISSUES:
✓ 1) When adding a brew session, sometimes the backend adds duplicates for filters, methods, grinders etc. 
   - FIXED: Updated find_by_name to use case-insensitive, whitespace-trimmed comparison
   - This prevents duplicates like "Paper Filter" vs "paper filter" vs " Paper Filter "

✓ 2) The brew temperature field doesn't accept fractional numbers (floats) and will just ignore the entry.
   - FIXED: Backend was already using safe_float(), frontend supports decimals with step="0.1"
   - Temperatures like 93.5°C now work correctly

✓ 3) When deleting the duplicate items from 1) the "Replace with other item and delete" options doesn't seem to work.
   - VERIFIED: This functionality is working correctly
   - The replace functionality only appears when an item is in use AND there are alternatives available
   - Comprehensive tests added to verify both replace and remove reference functionality

✓ 4) I'm unable to edit a brew session to change the product and batch, that gives me a 404 error
   - FIXED: The issue was that HTML forms send IDs as strings, but backend expected integers
   - Added string-to-integer conversion in the PUT /api/brew_sessions/<id> endpoint
   - Also added validation to ensure batch belongs to the specified product
   - Now properly handles both frontend form submissions (string IDs) and API calls (integer IDs)
   - Added comprehensive tests for all scenarios including string ID conversion

All bugs have been fixed and comprehensive tests have been added to prevent regression.

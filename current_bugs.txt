Bug list:

1) When adding a brew session, sometimes the backend adds duplicates for filters, methods, grinders etc. This seems to mostly be happening on the tablet for some reason. We should never add a new item with the same name as an existing one.
2) When deleting the duplicate items from 1) the "Replace with other item and delete" options doesn't seem to work. It will just remove the reference and then delete the item.
3) I'm unable to edit a brew session to change the product and batch, that gives me a 404 error
